# Weather Journal App - Backend

## Introduction

The backend of the Weather Journal App handles the server-side logic to manage API requests, process data, and support the front-end interface. This project represents my journey to overcome past challenges and demonstrate my growth as a full-stack developer.

## Story & Inspiration

Four years ago, I struggled with creating a weather app, leading to self-doubt about my technical skills. After attending Holberton School, I revisited this project to showcase my improved abilities. This backend serves as the backbone of the app, managing data processing and communication with the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Technical Details

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust framework for server-side operations. It communicates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and process weather data based on user input.

### Key Features

- **API Integration:** Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Data Management:** Efficiently handles and processes data to support the front end.
- **Error Handling:** Provides meaningful feedback for invalid input or API errors.

### Challenges Faced

Managing asynchronous requests and ensuring efficient data handling were significant challenges. I focused on optimizing server response time and enhancing error handling mechanisms.

### Future Improvements

- **Database Integration:** Adding a database to store user queries and weather data for historical insights.
- **Caching:** Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve performance.
- **Enhanced API Features:** Adding endpoints for extended weather forecasts and geolocation support.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aughostinos/Weather_Journal_App.git
   cd Weather_Journal_App
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

The backend server runs on `http://localhost:3000`. It provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /weather/:zip`: Fetches weather data for the provided zip code.
